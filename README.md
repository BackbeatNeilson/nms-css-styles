## Overview

The CSS in this repository is designed to serve as a centralized stylesheet for all Mandela School web templates. By using this CSS file, projects can maintain a consistent look and feel in terms of branding colors, typography, layouts, and icons.

## Features

- **CSS Variables:** Easily configurable brand colors and font settings.
- **Typography:** Base styles for headings and body text.
- **Responsive Layouts:** Grid systems and media queries to support different screen sizes.
- **Component Styling:** Pre-defined styles for cards, footers, and lists.
- **Font Awesome Overrides:** Custom icon sizing and styling ensuring visual consistency.

## Getting Started

To use the stylesheet in your project:

1. **Include the CSS:**  
   Add the following line in the `<head>` section of your HTML:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://yourusername.github.io/css-styles/styles.css">
   ```

2. **Customize (Optional):**  
   If you need to override or add additional styles, copy the repository and modify as needed.

## Usage

- **Centralized Updates:**  
  By hosting the CSS on GitHub Pages, any updates to this file will automatically propagate to all projects that link to it.

- **Cache Busting:**  
  If you make significant changes, consider appending a query string (e.g., `?v=1.0.1`) to the URL to force browsers to fetch the latest version.
